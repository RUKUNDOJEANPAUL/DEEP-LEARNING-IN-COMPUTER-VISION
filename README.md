# DEEP-LEARNING-IN-COMPUTER-VISION
Image classification is a popular domain in Machine Learning in recent years which can be solved by deep learning methods. In this project, We use Artificial Neural Network (ANN) which can operate the image classification of Fashion-MNIST dataset [1] to build and train a neural network model to classify images of clothing like sneakers, shirts, bags and shoes.  The dataset includes 70000 grayscale images whose size is 28*28 [2]. The best accuracy of the  model can reach 82%. We use Keras, a High level API  to build and train model in Tensorflow.
